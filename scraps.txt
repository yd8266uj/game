They don't know what's wrong with that place. Honestly, they don't really care. They do know not to go there and that how its always been. The oldest among them recall hearing about a family that used to live there but, nobody can remember the name. Some nights they claim to see movement in the windows or hear disturbing noises. No one dares to get a closer look. Anyone that gets close enough is surely damned.

Perhaps the manor was once owned by a powerful family. Though what would bring such a family to an ends like this is anyone's guess. Some say they did something terrible, that they were punished with this terrible place. Others say this place was damned long before they got here. That the lucky ones who got away never looked back. One thing is for sure, This place will destroy anything good in it. 

Though, perhaps if you play its cruel game, it might just reward you.

This a game of social deduction and role playing. The heart of this game lies in having conversations and interacting with the other players. The social deduction comes from trying to figure out what cards the other players are holding based on what they say or how they act. The role playing comes from incorporating the behaviours of your cards into your actions. You will be rewarded for playing the role of your persona by being allowed to make an exchange. You will want to use these exchanges to influence the circumstances surrounding yourself or other players. Deducing the Animus of other players will allow you to make informed exchanges when the opportunity arises. At the end of a round of play, all players will look at their circumstance card and compare it to their Animus.

    The driving force behind a character. When no one is looking what do you really want? What will you do to get it? "How can I help?" -your friend, The Manor. An Animus has a mission for your character to complete, an elimination condition and will tell you your default circumstance.

    Sometimes your fate is set in stone. Sometimes, you can escape your fate. It's not as easy as telling fate that you don't want to be a victim. No, you are going to have to find another victim to take your place. When you exchange with another player, swap circumstance cards with the other player.

    <dfn id="def-mc" class="scrollspy">MC</dfn>

  <dd>
    The master of ceremonies. Maybe this is you, the person actually taking the time to read these rules. The MC is responsible for facilitating the game. You are the one setting out cards and maybe even narrating the horrible things that are about to happen. Feel free to delegate MC responsibilities or make someone else be MC as you see fit.

    <dfn id="def-persona" class="scrollspy">Persona</dfn>

  <dd>
    A mask that the character wears. This is what the others see when they look at your character. As player, try to embrace your character's persona. The persona are left intentionally vague and may be interpreted many ways. If your trait is cold, maybe you are an unfriendly person? or maybe you just prefer to eviscerate your victims in the walk in cooler? A persona has a list of traits and an embodiment.

  <dd>
    The fact that your character is in this forsaken place speaks to how shitty they must have been before coming here. Still, no one could possibly deserve more misfortune than this manor has already provided. The manor disagrees. Every round a new woe will fall upon the manor. If you have earned the favor of the manor, perhaps you will find a boon in the tragic fates of the others. Most likely, you are just as screwed as everyone else.

    Maybe you saw a flash of an image or noticed a pattern in that stain on the carpet. The manor has seen fit to impart upon you some piece of eldritch knowledge. When you recall what you have seen, there is something just beyond your perception. It claws at the edge of your mind, you look and nothing is there but a lone word fills your thoughts. You should probably be ashamed of whatever you did to please the manor enough for it to share this with you.
