            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <aside class="card-panel z-depth-0 flow-text read-aloud">Lightning flashes and the lights go dark...as the rumble of thunder fades, the lamps flicker to life. Questioning murmurs break the silence, until the room is once again filled with the sounds of polite conversation. &lt;&lt;scream&gt;&gt; shatters the renewed quiescence. The guests rush toward the noise only to find dear old Mrs. pennybottom face down on the ground, a broken billiards stick juts up from where it pierces her back. She writhes in a growing pool of her own warm blood. She speaks with airless gasps of a woman taking her last breaths. With a final effort she reaches out with a sanguine hand, extending her arm towards the crowd. Darkness takes her. Her body goes limp. Her hand  lands weakly on the floor, palm down, fingers splayed.</aside>

            <p class="flow-text">Welcome to Murder at the Manor, a unique murder mystery party game. This is game of social deduction for five to twelve players. You and your friends will not set out to play solely this game. Instead, like a traditional murder mystery, this game will unfold while you and your friends do other activities. Play takes place during rounds which typically last 30 to 60 minutes (your <a class="def-link" href="#def-host">host</a> will decide). Players will take on the roles of classic murder mystery characters, with a twist.</p>

            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p class="flow-text">For each secret identity card select the appropriate draw card and place them together into an empty dossier envelope. Shuffle the character cards and without looking deal one into each empty dossier. Shuffle the dossiers and place them onto the play mat.</p>
            <aside class="info card-panel teal lighten-1 flow-text white-text">Try to position the play mat somewhere easily accessable but private enough that player can grab new cards without anyone overseeing.</aside>

          <div id="beginning-play" class="section scrollspy">
            <h2>Beginning Play</h2>
            <p class="flow-text">At the beginning of the game, each player will receive a random dossier. At any time a new player may join by selecting a random dossier.</p>
            <aside class="info card-panel teal lighten-1 flow-text white-text">Optional rule: you may reveal the character cards during selections (keep other cards secret). Players may choose or the <a class="def-link" href="#def-host">host</a> may assign a dossier.</aside>

          <div id="playing-a-round" class="section scrollspy">
            <h2>Playing a Round</h2>
            <p class="flow-text">Your main goal during a round of play is to figure out the secret identities and statuses of the other guests. You will manipulate who has which status card in order to score points based on your secret identity as described in the next section. You cannot look at your own or any other player’s status card during play. You cannot show you secret identity card to anyone during play. You are welcome to tell people what your cards are if you think it’s a good idea.</p>
            <p class="flow-text">To move a status card you must do what is listed under embodiment on your character card. You can then trade with any one player directly involved in the action performed as part of your embodiment. You cannot trade back unless the situation has changed. For example, one or both of you was involved in another trade or if a sufficient amount of time has passed for the scene to change (a few minutes). If there is ever a dispute about embodiment, grab someone nearby who heard what happened. Ask them to make a ruling, this ruling is the law.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
              <h3>Ending a Round</h3>
              <p class="flow-text">Look at your status card in private and compare it with your secret identity.</p>
              <p class="flow-text">If your status card matches one of the success conditions and if another player can confirm that you played up one of the traits from your character card, your character has succeeded. You score a point, congratulations.</p>
              <aside class="comment flow-text">This is unclear. Needs cleanup.</aside>
              <p class="flow-text">If your status card matches one of the failure conditions, your character is now dead or something else bad. You do not score a point, sorry. </p>
              <aside class="pitfall card-panel red lighten-1 flow-text white-text">Your cards may contradict these rules. Remember, specific beats general.</aside>
              <p class="flow-text">Either way, your character has left the manor. Go ahead and narrate your thrilling success or crushing defeat. At a minimum, let the other players know your secret identity and what your status card was. You may grab a new dossier for the next round.</p>
              <p class="flow-text">If there are no matches, you must stay in the manor. Discard your status card and replace it with the draw card indicated on your secret identity.</p>
