              Welcome to Murder at the Manor, a unique murder mystery party game. 
              This is a game of social deduction for five to twelve players. 
              Like a traditional murder mystery, this game will unfold over the course of an entire night and you will take on the role of a classic murder mystery persona.
              During play you and your group will do whatever you normally do without this game.
              However, instead of asking Angie the Accountant if she could grab you a soda, you are now asking Angie the Big Game Hunter and Secret Cult Leader to get you a soda.
            </p>
            <aside class="info card-panel teal lighten-1 flow-text white-text">
              Asking for someone to get you a soda could actually be a game winning strategy.
            </aside>
            <p class="flow-text">
              Interacting with others in the same way your persona would (we call this embodiment) allows you to exchange circumstances with them. 
              Throughout the night, disasters will strike the manor (Like what happened to poor old Mrs. Pennybottom) and players will check to see if their current circumstance is beneficial or harmful to their hidden identity (animus). The results of this check will determine the outcome of this game.

            <p class="flow-text">
              For each animus card, select the circumstance card listed as its starting circumstance.
              Place both cards into an empty dossier envelope.
              Randomly distribute one persona card into each dossier.
              Each dossier should now contain one persona card, one animus card, and one circumstance card.
              Shuffle the completed dossiers and place them onto the play mat.
            </p>
            <aside class="pitfall card-panel red lighten-1 flow-text white-text">The Cultist card may look like it belongs in the animus pile. Don't drink the reconstituted powdered soft drink flavoring agent, put cultist in the circumstance pile</aside>
            <aside class="info card-panel teal lighten-1 flow-text white-text">
              Try to position the play mat somewhere easily accessible but private enough that players can grab new cards without anyone overseeing.
            </aside>
            <p class="flow-text">
              The host should choose an appropriate round length and number of rounds. 
              Aim for rounds of 20 to 60 minutes in length and a number of rounds between 3 and 8.
            </p>
            <aside class="info card-panel teal lighten-1 flow-text white-text">
              Rounds can be fixed durations. 
              However, you may tie the ends of round to what your group is doing. 
              If you are playing other board games, one round could be one board game. 
              If you are watching football, a round could be one quarter.

            <h2 class="truncate">Beginning Play</h2>
            <p class="flow-text">At the beginning of the game, each player will receive a random dossier. At any time a new player may join by selecting a random dossier.</p>
            <aside class="info card-panel teal lighten-1 flow-text white-text">Optional rule: you may reveal the character cards during selections (keep other cards secret). Players may choose or the <a class="def-link" href="#def-host">host</a> may assign a dossier.</aside>
          </div>
          <div id="playing-a-round" class="section scrollspy">
            <h2 class="truncate">Playing a Round</h2>
            <p class="flow-text">Your main goal during a round of play is to figure out the persona and animus of the other players. You will manipulate who has which status card in order to score points based on your secret identity as described in the next section. You cannot look at your own or any other player's status card during play. You cannot show you secret identity card to anyone during play. You are welcome to tell people what your cards are if you think it's a good idea.</p>
            <p class="flow-text">To move a status card you must do what is listed under embodiment on your character card. You can then trade with any one player directly involved in the action performed as part of your embodiment. You cannot trade back unless the situation has changed. For example, one or both of you was involved in another trade or if a sufficient amount of time has passed for the scene to change (a few minutes). If there is ever a dispute about embodiment, grab someone nearby who heard what happened. Ask them to make a ruling, this ruling is the law.</p>
            <p class="flow-text">To formally begin a round, the <a class="def-link" href="#def-host">host</a> should begin a round timer.</p>
            <div class="subsection">
              <h3 class="truncate">Ending a Round</h3>
              <p class="flow-text">The <a class="def-link" href="#def-host">host</a> will mark the end of a round by drawing a card. When a card is drawn, the round is over. Follow the directions on the card.</p>
              <p class="flow-text">Look at your status card in private and compare it with your secret identity.</p>
              <p class="flow-text">If your status card matches one of the success conditions and if another player can confirm that you played up one of the traits from your character card, your character has succeeded. You score a point, congratulations.</p>
              <aside class="comment flow-text">This is unclear. Needs cleanup.</aside>
              <p class="flow-text">If your status card matches one of the failure conditions, your character is now dead or something else bad. You do not score a point, sorry. </p>
              <aside class="pitfall card-panel red lighten-1 flow-text white-text">Your cards may contradict these rules. Remember, specific beats general.</aside>
              <p class="flow-text">Either way, your character has left the manor. Go ahead and narrate your thrilling success or crushing defeat. At a minimum, let the other players know your secret identity and what your status card was. You may grab a new dossier for the next round.</p>
              <p class="flow-text">If there are no matches, you must stay in the manor. Discard your status card and replace it with the draw card indicated on your secret identity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="subsection">
              <h3 class="truncate">Before the next Round</h3>
              <p class="flow-text">Take a five-ish minute break. No swapping cards but feel free to swap trash talk. If your character left the manor last round, grab a new dossier. If your character is still around and you need a new circumstance card, grab it.</p>
              <aside class="pitfall card-panel red lighten-1 flow-text white-text">If there are only a couple of prepared dossiers left on the play mat, take the cards out of the dossiers. Combine these cards with the discard pile and follow the setup procedure.</aside>

            <h2 class="truncate">Wrapping Up</h2>
            <aside class="comment flow-text">There should be something more appealing than simply counting points here.</aside>
            <p class="flow-text">When the set number of rounds have passed or whenever your <a class="def-link" href="#def-host">host</a> decides, Have everyone total up their points. Whoever has the most points wins.</p>
            <aside class="comment flow-text">I think that a good way to determine a winner might be a lottery type system. Scoring points would buy entries into the lottery. It would give short term players a chance to win but give a better chance to more successful and longer term players. You could use searching rooms for a treasure or finding potential vault codes as a narrative reason for the lottery.</aside>
